    "Models and wells are important and they build the foundation of gwrefpy. Models are used to represent a site or area of interest, and wells are used to represent locations where groundwater data is collected. There is no limit to the number of models or wells that can be created in gwrefpy, nor is there a restriction on the order in which they are created. Models and wells can be created independently of one another, and they can be linked together later.\n",
